# Computation-physics-PHY407
Python (numpy, scipy) simulations of simple physical systems.
//
A series of 12 class projects involving data processing and analysis, ODE and PDE solvers/time steppers, Monte Carlo simulations, and general computation/transformation algorithms. 
//
Each Python file corresponds to a project report. 
Some Python codes are adapted from Newman's _Computation Physics_.
