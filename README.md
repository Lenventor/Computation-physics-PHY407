# Computation-physics-PHY407
Python (numpy, scipy) simulations of simple physical systems.<br />

A series of 12 class projects involving data processing and analysis, ODE and PDE solvers/time steppers, Monte Carlo simulations, and general computation/transformation algorithms. <br />

Each Python file corresponds to a project report. <br />
Some Python codes are adapted from _Computation Physics_ by Mark Newman.
